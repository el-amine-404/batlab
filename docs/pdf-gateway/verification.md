# Verification log

Capability status values are `IMPLEMENTED`, `VERIFIED`, `BLOCKED`, and
`NOT STARTED`. Commands are recorded without credentials or private content.

## 2026-10-25 — M0 baseline

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Unsafe prototype containment | VERIFIED | Prototype retained only on `archive/pdf-gateway-prototype-2026-10-25`; six containers removed; runtime data retained. |
| Real corpus inventory | VERIFIED | Read-only `find` counted 703 PDFs / 928,905,037 bytes under `/home/bro/Documents`; no files moved. |
| Lab2 baseline | VERIFIED | 8 CPUs, 31 GiB RAM, cgroup v2, 36 GiB root free, 1.9 TiB data free. |
| Portable archive contracts | IMPLEMENTED | Strict metadata/taxonomy schemas and OpenAPI draft are tracked and syntax-tested. |
| Threat model | IMPLEMENTED | Trust boundaries, abuse cases, fail-closed decisions, and residual risks are documented. |
| Dangerzone CDR | BLOCKED | Debian 13 is supported, but Lab2 currently has neither Podman nor Dangerzone/gVisor. A fingerprint-verifying installer and fail-closed conversion probe are tracked; host installation still requires interactive sudo. Ordinary Docker is explicitly rejected as sufficient proof. |
| Exposed Paperless token | VERIFIED | Archived prototype token matched the live token. It was replaced in Paperless and `compose/.env`; Homepage and Paperless GPT were recreated; an authenticated API request using the new token returned HTTP 200. No token value was logged. |
| M1 | NOT STARTED | Begins only from these contracts; release remains impossible until CDR capability is verified. |

Commands used:

```text
find /home/bro/Documents -type f -iname '*.pdf' -printf '%s\n'
ssh lab2 'nproc; free -h; df -h / /mnt/storage/data; stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup'
ssh lab2 'command -v dangerzone-cli podman runsc'
python3 pdf-gateway/tools/validate_contracts.py
```

Unchecked risks: the CDR package/signing-key installation and isolation test require an explicit
host installation step; no source document has entered the new pipeline.
